## How does the web ?

- HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

- HTTP is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

- The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

- A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser. URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.

- Representations is one of these things that doesn't get used a lot. In most cases, a resource has only a single representation. But we're hoping that representations will be used more in the future because there's a bunch of new formats popping up all over the place.

- Computers can use those same protocols to send messages back and forth to each other. None of the techniques used today work well when you need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the entire world.

- We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.

# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Our data-saturated age enables us to examine our work habits and office quirks with a scrutiny that our cubicle-bound forebears could only dream of. Today, on corporate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologists, sociologists and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better and more productive versions of themselves.

# APIs

It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.

# SuperAgent:

SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js!
