# What Is Node.js?

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. When we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. Rather, the creator of Node took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

# What Are the Advantages of Node.js?

- Aside from speed and scalability.

- speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web.

- JavaScript is ubiquitous: most of us are familiar with JavaScript, or have used it at some point. This means that transitioning to Node development is potentially easier than to other server-side languages.

# What Kind of Apps Is Node.js Suited To?

Suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration, for example:

- _chat sites_

- _apps such as CodeShare_ you can watch a document being edited live by someone else

JavaScript is everywhere, and Node is a vast and expansive subject.
