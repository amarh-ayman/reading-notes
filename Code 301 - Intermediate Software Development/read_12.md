# EJS Partials

Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you donâ€™t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.
Partials. When using the default view engine ( ejs ), Sails supports the use of partials (i.e. "view partials"). Partials are basically just views that are designed to be used from within other views. They are particularly useful for reusing the same markup between different views, layouts, and even other partials.
