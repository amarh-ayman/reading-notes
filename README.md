**A growth mindset is simply the belief that our basic abilities can be developed and improved through dedication and hard work. It's just that without a growth mindset, we don't exert the required effort and so we remain perpetually stuck.**

Growth Mindset in short is getting out of the box 
If we have a “fixed mindset,” we may shy away from challenges because we do not want to feel embarrassed or humiliated in front of others—who does, right?! 

we can develope ourselves by effort, face challenge, get feedback from rhe mistakes , obtacles and dont lost focus.
