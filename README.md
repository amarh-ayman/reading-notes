A growth mindset is simply the belief that our basic abilities can be developed and improved through dedication and hard work. 
It's just that without a growth mindset, we don't exert the required effort and so we remain perpetually stuck.
growth Mindset in short is getting out of the box 
If we have a “fixed mindset,” we may shy away from challenges because we do not want to feel embarrassed or humiliated in front of others—who does, right?! 

If we have a “growth mindset,” we enjoy challenges, despite the risk, usually because we value learning and growth more than others thinking we know what we’re doing. 
And because we’re always trying new things, we often don’t know what we’re doing.

##  Key Differences Between “Fixed” and “Growth” Mindset:
