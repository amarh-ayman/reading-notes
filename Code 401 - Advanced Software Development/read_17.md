# Web Scrape with Python

### What is Web Scraping?

> a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website,
> which can save a huge amount of time and effort.

### Important notes about web scraping

- check the legal stuff about using the data, read the Terms and Conditions of the website.
- do not frequently and rapidly download data, as to avoid breaking the web or even getting blocked from website.

### Inspecting the Website

It important to scan and check the website for the pupose of finding relevant pieces of code that contains our data.
then simply do the "inspect".

#### Python Code

- **librarie to use**:

  > import requests

        import urllib.request
        import time
        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

- **set the url to the website and access the site with our requests library**

  > url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'
  > response = requests.get(url)

- **parse the html with BeautifulSoup**

  > soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)

- **locate all of our <a> tags**
  > soup.findAll('a')

-**extract the actual link**

> one_a_tag = soup.findAll(‘a’)[38]
> link = one_a_tag[‘href’]

> download*url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
> urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile*')+1:])

> time.sleep(1)
