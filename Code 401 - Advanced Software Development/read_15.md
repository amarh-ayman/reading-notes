# Trees

## Common Terminology

> Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it’s own values, and references to other nodes

    Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
    K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
    Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
    Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
    Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
    Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
    Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### How to traverse "Trees"?

- > traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more!
- Recursion is the most common way to traverse trees
- **Categories of traversals**:

  - _Depth First:_ prioritize goiing to depth first
    **Methods**

    - Pre-order: root >> left >> right

      > ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

          OUTPUT <-- root.value

          if root.left is not NULL
              preOrder(root.left)

          if root.right is not NULL
             preOrder(root.right)

    - In-order: left >> root >> right

      > ALGORITHM inOrder(root)
      > // INPUT <-- root node
      > // OUTPUT <-- in-order output of tree node's values

           if root.left is not NULL
               inOrder(root.left)

           OUTPUT <-- root.value

           if root.right is not NULL
               inOrder(root.right)

    - Post-order: left >> right >> root

      > ALGORITHM postOrder(root)
      > // INPUT <-- root node
      > // OUTPUT <-- post-order output of tree node's values

            if root.left is not NULL
                postOrder(root.left)

            if root.right is not NULL
                postOrder(root.right)

            OUTPUT <-- root.value

  - _Breadth First:_

    - > Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node
    - > breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion)
    - > ALGORITHM breadthFirst(root)

           // INPUT  <-- root node
           // OUTPUT <-- front node of queue to console

           Queue breadth <-- new Queue()
           breadth.enqueue(root)

           while breadth.peek()
               node front = breadth.dequeue()
               OUTPUT <-- front.value

               if front.left is not NULL
               breadth.enqueue(front.left)

               if front.right is not NULL
               breadth.enqueue(front.right)

## Binary Trees

- only have two children
- no specific sorting order

## Binary Search Trees

- > A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right

## K-ary Trees

- nodes can have more than two children
