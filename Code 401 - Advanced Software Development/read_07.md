## Python Scope & the LEGB Rule

### Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope

- global names can be accessed or refrenced globally; from any position in the code. However, they can be updated, edited or modified from within the global scope.
- local names

  > you can access local names only from inside the local Python scope they were created in or from inside a nested function, but you can’t access them from the global Python scope or from other local scopes.

- nonlocal names
  > can be accessed from inside nested functions, but they can’t be modified or updated from there.

### Python provides the keywords (global and nonlocal) as to change the content of global and nonlocal names, however it is a bad practice.

### The global Statement

- > The statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. You can also use multiple global statements with a name (or a list of names). All the names that you list in a global statement will be mapped to the global or module scope in which you define them.

- Example:
  > … counter = 0 # A global name … def update_counter(): … global counter # Declare counter as global … counter = counter + 1 # Successfully update the counter

> … global_counter = 0 # A global name … def update_counter(counter): … return counter + 1 # Rely on a local name

- UnboundLocalError an error that is shown when trying to access a variable that is not defined in a certain scope.

### The nonlocal Statement

- > The nonlocal statement consists of the nonlocal keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope.

- it is used in nested functions, it cannot be used in a global or local scope.
- Example:

  > … def func(): … var = 100 # A nonlocal variable … def nested(): … nonlocal var # Declare var as nonlocal … var += 100

- A SyntaxError arises when trying to define a nonlocal name using the nonlocal statement and it doesn’t exist in the enclosing scope of the function.
