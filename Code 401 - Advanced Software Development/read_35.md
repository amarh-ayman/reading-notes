## magic cunctions

> - special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example **init** or **str**.\*

> We can ise them to initialize, stringfy, iterate objects.

## Iterators

> - They’ll serve as “non-magical” examples and test implementations you can build upon and deepen your understanding with..\*

- _The Repeater iterator iterates forever._

## Generators

> - If you’ve ever implemented a class-based iterator from scratch in Python, you know that this endeavour requires writing quite a bit of boilerplate code..\*

**Iterators are so useful in Python: They allow you to write pretty for-in loops and help you make your code more Pythonic and efficient.**

> As a (proud) “lazy” Python developer, I don’t like tedious and repetitive work.
