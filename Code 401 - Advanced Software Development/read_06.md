## Random Module in Python
 - Random module is used when a random number feature is required; e.g. choosing a random number/item/card..etc
 - can be imported through (import random)
### What is a random module?
 - provides access to functions that support many operations allows you to generate random numbers

## Random Functions
 - Randint(random integer between two integers)
Example: random.randint(0, 5)

 - Random(large random number)
Example: random.random() * 100

 - Choice (random value from the sequence sequence, e.g. a list)
Example: random.choice( [‘red’, ‘black’, ‘green’] )

 - Shuffle (shuffles a list’s elements)
Example: shuffle([[i] for i in range(10)])

 - Randrange (random element from a given range)
Example: random.randrange(0, 101, 5)

## Risk Analysis in Software Testing
 - Risk Analysis is a process where the potential risks ;problem areas in the built software are identified, categorized and calculated.
 - It is used in software testing, so that it mitigates the risks.

### Possible Risks:
 - Use of new hardware
 - Use of new technology
 - Use of new automation tool
 - The sequence of code
 - Availability of test resources for the application
### Unavoidable Risks:
 - testing time
 - defect leakage(application size or complexity)
 - clients’ urgency
 - Incomplete requirements
### risk magnitude indicators can be high, medium, or  - low.
### Risk Identification Process
 - Business Risks
 - Testing Risks
 - Premature Release Risk
 - Software Risks
### Risk Assessment(Effect-> Cause -> Likelihood)
 - perspective : > Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
 - Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

 - Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

 - How to perform Risk Assessment?
    - Search the risk –> Analyze the risk impact –> Measure the risk
