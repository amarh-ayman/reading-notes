## Object-relational mapper

> Deﬁne your data models entirely in Python. You get a rich, dynamic database-access API for free — but you can still write SQL if needed.

## URLs and views

> To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. Like a table of contents for your app, it contains a simple mapping between URL patterns and your views.

> from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('bands/', views.band_listing, name='band-list'),
        path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name='band-detail'),
        path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name='band-search'),
    ]

## Templates

- python has a library that renders forms as html

  > from django import forms

      class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
          subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
          message = forms.CharField()
          sender = forms.EmailField()
          cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)

## Forms

> Django comes with a full-featured and secure authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions. This lets you easily build sites that allow users to create accounts and safely log in/out.

## Admin

> from django.contrib import admin

    from bands.models import Band, Member

    class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
        """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
        list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
        list_filter = ('band',)

    admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
    admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options

## Internationalization

> Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers, and time zones

## Security

> Django provides multiple protections against:

    Clickjacking
    Cross-site scripting
    Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    SQL injection
    Remote code execution
