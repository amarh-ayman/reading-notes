# Graphs

> _A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of `vertices` (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named `edges`._

## Directed vs Undirected

- **Undirected Graphs:**

> _An Undirected Graph is a graph where each
> edge is undirected or bi-directional._

- **Directed Graphs (Digraph):**

> _A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a
> graph where every edge is directed._

- **a Digraph has direction.**

_Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next._

> **The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.**

## Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected

> _There are many different types of graphs. This depends on how connected the graphs are to other node/vertices._

---

## 1. Complete Graphs

> _A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes._

## 2. Connected

> _A connected graph is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge._

> > > **A Tree is a form of a connected graph.**

---

## 3. Disconnected

> _A disconnected graph is a graph where some `vertices` may **Not** have `edges`._

_the disconnected graph shows that some nodes may not always be connected to other nodes or vertices of the graph._

It is complelty possible to have
standalone `nodes` or `edges` _(also known as
islands)_ in a graph.

## Acyclic Graph

> _An acyclic graph is a directed graph without cycles._

**A cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.**
