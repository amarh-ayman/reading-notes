# Cryptography

## Encryption, decryption, and cracking

#### Caesar Cipher

is an encryption technique, invented by Julius Caesar two thousand years ago for the purpose of communicating messages to his allies.

> is a simple substitution cipher which replaces each original letter with a different letter in the alphabet by shifting the alphabet by a certain amount.

#### Decrypting a message is usually done by de-coding the encrypted message, following a certain agreed on pattern.

#### Cracking the cipher

A message/code can be cracked/de-coded using multiple techniques:

- Frequency analysis (detecting the letters that are used freqeuntly)
- Known plaintext (in case of knowing some parts of the plaintext --> the original unencrypted message)
- Brute force

> uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

#### Example

> Plaintext: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
> Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
