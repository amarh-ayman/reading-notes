# IMAGE'S

> A picture can say a thousand words, and great <br> images help make the difference between an <br> average-looking site and a really engaging one

### \<img>

To add an image into the page you need to use an \<img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
<br>

### src

This tells the browser where it can find the image file (URL)
<br>

### alt

This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
<br>

### title

You can also use the title attribute with the \<img> element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image
<br><br>

- The \<img> element is used to add images to a web page.
- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
- You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs

# COLOR'S

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

### rgb values

These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.

> example: rgb(100,100,90)

### hex codes

These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.

> example: #ee3e80

### color names

There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. >example:DarkCyan

- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
  RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
  with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA

# TEXT

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
