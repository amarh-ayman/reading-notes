- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.


- The HTML \<script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the \<link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created. 

# WHAT IS A VARIABLE? 

- A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

- A variable is a good name for this
concept because the data stored
in a variable can change (or vary)
each time a script runs. 

- before use a variable ,you need to announce that you want to use it . 
for example : 
## var x ;
 - var is a variable keyword , while (x) is a varible name
## x=5;
 - 5 is a variable value

# DATA TYPES

- JavaScript distinguishes between numbers,
strings, and true or false values known as
Booleans.

  - NUMERIC DATA TYPE
    The numeric data type handles numbers.
     - 1 ,0.5 , -100

  - STRING DATA TYPE
The strings data type consists of letters and other characters.

     - 'H.1 ' Ivy! 1    

   - BOOLEAN DATA TYPE
Boolean data types can have one of two values: 
        - true or false.
