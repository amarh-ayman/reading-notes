# PROCCESS AND DESIGN

- For build a web page you must understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

- Wireframes {which is the shape of your web page, the primary design} allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication.

- Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.

- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# HTML5 LAYOUT

- Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

- Html uses elements to describe the structure of pages

- HTML pages are text documents.

# EXTRA MARKUP

- Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML. So that for making the browser understand, DOCTYPE is the solution, and it came in the top of the code

        <! DOCTYPE HTML>

- If you want to add a comment in your code , as a HINT ;for understanding each step you have done in your code in the future (which you will forget the half of it) , OR if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand and another benefit of it that comment are not visible to the users while running the code in the main browser window.

- Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements
  - Examples \<h1> \<p> \<ul>
- Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
  Exampe \<em> \<img> <\a> <\b>
- \<div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box, It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used \<div> elements to hold each section of the page.
- \<span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the \<div> element.
- An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame
- The \<meta> element lives inside the \<head> element and contains information about that web page, The value of the name attribute can be anything you want it to be
