#INTRO

## WHAT IS A SCRIPT AND HOW DO I CREATE ONE ??

- A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.
- Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
- Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.
- To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

# EXPRESSIONS

An **expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value.

- there are two types of expressions:

  - EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE

    - var color = 'beige';

  - EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
    - var area = 3 \* 2;

# OPERATORS

**operators** allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values. - same examples in expression and for more - X = 3 > 5 - Y =(5 >3) && (2 < 4>)

# WHAT IS A FUNCTION?

**Functions** let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script **repeat the same task**, you can
**reuse** the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

for making functions you need to make declarations first by give it name and open braces then write any statements needed
as

- function sayHello( ){
  document.write('Hello!'); }


    # Calling Functions

- is a process used if you need the code you wrote or any function in the system

- you can call it by :
  - sayHello( )
    - write the name of the function

> so for make the process more easier on you at CALLING Function just make the name of it simple .
