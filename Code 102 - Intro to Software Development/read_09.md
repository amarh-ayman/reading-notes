# What’s make any machine a computer ??

It must have Four stages :

- Input
- Storage
- Processing
- Output

First of all, **input** is what the user put on the computer ,by mouse, keyboard, camera , microphone.  
Secondary the **input** while stored in memory ,and the **processer** will take info from the **storage** and make multiple manipulations or change it using algorithm which is a series of commands , after that the processed info back to be stored in memory again ,this continue until the processed info is ready to be in **output**

The end of story , is the **output** can be what the computer display on the screen ,as text ,video or a sound

# Binary System

The computer as a hardware contain an electric wires and circuits that carry info in the computer
the signal in wire can be on or off

## On=true= yes =1

## Off=false=no=0

Each wire hold 2 possibility of values (0 or 1) and these called bits

So that more wires meaning more data ,meaning more bits : more ones and zeros , with more bits you can represent more complex information

### 0 and 1 called binary system

If we have 2 wires then the possibility of (numbers of info) you can store is 4

| first wire | second wire |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 (on)     | 1 (on)      |
| 1 (on)     | 0 (off)     |
| 0 (off)    | 1 (on)      |
| 0 (off)    | 0 (off)     |

While 3 wires make it 8
HOW THAT ???

| first wire | second wire | third wire |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| 1 (on)     | 1 (on)      | 1 (on)     |
| 1 (on)     | 1 (on)      | 0 (off)    |
| 1 (on)     | 0 (off)     | 1 (on)     |
| 1 (on)     | 0 (off)     | 0 (off)    |
| 0 (off)    | 1 (on)      | 1 (on)     |
| 0 (off)    | 1 (on)      | 0 (off)    |
| 0 (off)    | 0 (off)     | 1 (on)     |
| 0 (off)    | 0 (off)     | 0 (off)    |

> using math 2(#of possibility 0 or 1) ^ #of wires

> 2^4=16bit

> more wires meaning more information

We can easily convert any number from decimal to binary

## Also all text ,images ,videos and sounds can representing in binary

- In text each letter and symbol can representing as a number ,there is a standard table called ASCII code (for transformation)

- Images consist of pixels and each pixel has a color , and each of the colors can be representing by a numbers
  There is a million of pixels in images

- Videos consist of images move fast , in one second there is typically 30images , and this meaning 30 Billion images / second …… what a huge data !!!!!!!!!!!
