- Branches :
  used to work with different versions of a repository at the same time .

- Commits :
  Each commit (change) has a description explaining why a change was made.

- Pull Requests:
  proposing that your changes should be merged (pulled in) with the master and show content differences, changes, additions, and subtractions in colors (green and red).
